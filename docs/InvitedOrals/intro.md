# Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations

## Introduction

Conference programmes are generally composed of three types of 
presentation: *Invited Oral*, *Contributed Oral* and *Poster*. The ratio of 
the invited orals vs. contributed orals is decided by the Committee 
responsible for the scientific programme (for IPAC: SPC, for HB: IOC, 
etc.)

The invited orals are - in the case of IPAC - proposed
by members of the OC, SPC and SAB. All of them need to have JACOW 
profiles and must have the necessary privileges. For IPAC, the call for 
Invited Oral proposals goes out to OC, SPC and SAB approx. 15 months 
prior to the conference.

The sequence of events for IPAC is as follows:

1. **SAB/OC/SPC** members enter proposals into Indico via their 
   own profiles. Proposals consist of a title, a brief description of what
    the talk should cover, one or more candidates as proposed speakers and a Main Classification;
2. **SPC** members review the Main Classification assignments of *all* proposed abstracts;
3. **SPC MC Coordinators** accept/reject requests of classification changes from previous step;
4. **SPC** members review all proposals by assigning priorities/scores prior to the SPC/2 meeting;
5. **SPC MC Coordinators** confer with their "shadows" or "deputies" to 
   tag their priorities (1, 2nd and 3rd) to produce a preliminary list of 
   preferred invited oral presentations and reserves;
6. at the SPC/2 meeting, the **Session Coordinators** announce their 
   proposals (talks and schedule within the synoptic table) to the full SPC
    for discussion, with the aim to ultimately ensure the best possible 
   overall programme, eliminating overlap in content, avoiding clashes, 
   ensuring good geographical and gender balance.
