# Assigning priorities to proposals by SPC

---

*This is an explanation for the Scientific Programme Committee (SPC) on how to perform the **fourth step of the [workflow for the Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

---

Logging in SPC members will be able to return to the "*Call for Abstracts > Review*" interface that was already used for porposing Track changes. 

This time, when actually reviewing a proposal, they will see the **possibility to enter a priority** with one or more ratings, as shown in this figure:

As before, the options for review are:

- **Accept** means a suggestion for the SPC to accept this proposal: *this should be the normal option at this stage*

- **Reject**, similarly, suggests not to accept this proposal. For IPAC this *should NOT be used* unless for very special cases

- **Change track** was already done in the [previous steps](SPCtrackreview.md) and *should NOT be selected now*

- **Mark as duplicate** also is a *special case and rarely used*, only if and when the reviewer thinks the proposal is an exact duplicate of another. The exact abstract ID and titleare to be entered by way of the popup menu

- **Merge** is a request to merge this proposal with another. *This should not be used*


Since all abstracts should now be in the correct Tracks, SPC members should now go to the Track of their interest and enter their priorities with an *Accept* review. **They should NOT Review/Enter priorities if the abstract is of no interest.**
