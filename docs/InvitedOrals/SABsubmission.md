# OC/SPC/SAB: Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations

In this first step of the [workflow for the *Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations*](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow) the three committees create abstracts to be proposed to the SPC.

## Login to the IPAC Indico event

The usual URL for IPAC events is [https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPAC**XX**](https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPACXX) (e.g., [IPAC'23](https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPAC23), [IPAC'24](https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPAC24) etc.)

**To login to this special JACoW Indico installation, please be sure to use your JACoW account from the [JACoW Central Repository](https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/profile.html), which usually is *not* your email address.**

From the Central Repository it is also possible to **reset your password** by clicking the "**Forgotten Password**" button. However, you must enter your **username name** to retrieve your password - *if you have lost your username as well, please contact the specific IPAC Scientific Secretariat for help*.

**If you cannot login to the IPAC Indico event**, please try logging in the [JACoW Central Repository](https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/profile.html) first. If this works succesfully, try logging in this Indico with the same username/password. In case this won't work, contact the Scientific Secretariat/Event Administrator (contacts are usually provided in the IPAC event pages).

The abstract submission form will appear. Before continuing, please click on the **submission instructions** link and review any specific note for the given event. Every IPAC can have slightly different ways of organising abstracts, so please be aware of the specific directions available from that link.

All fields marked with a **red star** are mandatory. Below the image all needed fields are explained.

* **Title**: here goes the proposed title for the Invited Oral Presentation

* **Content**: the description, or abstract text, is needed here. Please describe what the proposed presenter is expected to develop with this contribution. A couple of notes: 
  
    * with Indico you can enrich the abstract content by using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). However, we ask you to refrain from using this feature. For IPAC abstracts **please only use plain text**  
  
    * also refrain from copying and pasting from word processors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. Special characters like non-standard ticks (``, ´´, etc.) or the *three-dots character* (...) could get bad results when creating the final abstracts booklet. Be sure that these kind of special characters are avoided

* **Contribution Type**: be sure to select "Invited Oral Presentation"
