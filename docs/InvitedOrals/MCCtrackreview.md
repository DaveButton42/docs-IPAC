# Accept/Reject Proposals for Track Changes by MC Coordinators

The Coordinator/Convener clicks on the Track for which they are responsible and sees the following (*example for MC1*):

The Coordinators/Conveners are asked to work through the abstracts in their Track and  concentrate on the abstracts where there is a proposal for a change of track.

**Taking ID 39 above**, clicking on the title of the submission the Coordinator/Convener will see the following:

The Coordinator can see that the abstract was *submitted in MC1* and that there is a *proposal to move it to MC2*.

## When no track change is needed

**If the Coordinator/Convener disagrees with the track change proposal, they should do nothing**. They should simply disregard the proposal. The original abstract will remain in the originally proposed Track. The Coordinator simply returns to the list of abstracts to be reviewed.

## When there is need to change the initially proposed track

**If the Coordinator/Convener agrees with the track change proposal, they should click on *Edit Track List* link seeable here above, select the proposed new Track, and Save**:

Abstract ID#39 then disappears from the MC1 list:

and appears under MC2. Now, ff the MC2 Coordinator/Convener agrees, they will leave the abstract as it is. If he disagrees he will edit the Track List again.

Coordinators/Conveners should at this stage refrain from using any other functionality.
