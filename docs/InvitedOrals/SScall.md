# Call for Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations

Once the system preparations are complete, the Event Administrator/SS sends an e-mail to the various committees (usually OC/SPC/SAB) via the **Organization/Roles Setup** interface. 
Click on the pencil icon close to the chosen role to send an email:

Another way of doing this is the Organization/Participant Roles. Click on "Filter
role" to de-select the roles not needed, select all and click on "Send emails":

Compose the e-mail, using the available placeholders at the bottom of the page. In the mail ensure the submitters receive clear instructions on how to enter proposals. For IPAC, proposers do not normally propose themselves as speakers. It is usual for SPC members to have been briefed by the Chair that they represent their fields of expertise. They do not represent their laboratories. Proposals should privilege the most topical work in their field of interest to the whole community.

A log of all e-mails sent may be found in the interface Reports / Logs. Select "Emails" to view those sent:

When the deadline for submission of proposals for invited orals is over, the SS/Admin should remove the names of **Authorized Submitters** from the screen **Workflow / Call for Abstracts / Submission / Settings / Authorized Submitters**, leaving only those persons who may be authorized to continue submitting beyond the deadline, for example, MC Conveners, SPC Chair.
