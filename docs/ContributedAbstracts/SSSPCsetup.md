# Setting up for the SPC review process

---

*These are the instructions for the Scientific Secretariat/Admin about how to setup Indico for the **second and following steps of the [Workflow for selection of Contributed Abstracts](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

---

## The Process

The details of this process are identical to what is described for the [proposals for invited oral presentations](../InvitedOrals/SSSPCsetup.md). Please refer to those instructions for all the single steps to follow.

After having accepted the selected abstracts as Contributed Oral Presentation, it is possible to bulk [accept all the remaining contributed abstracts as Poster Presentation](SSPosters.md).
