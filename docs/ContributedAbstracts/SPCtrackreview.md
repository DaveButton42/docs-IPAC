*This is an explanation for the Scientific Programme Committee (SPC) on how to  perform the **second step of the [Workflow for selection of Contributed Abstracts](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

## The Process

The details of this process are identical to the one already followed for the [proposals for invited oral presentations](../InvitedOrals/SPCtrackreview.md). The only difference consists of the Reviewing Area where all the subclassifications are now listed instead of the main classifications seen before.
