# Accepting Poster presentations

From the "Call for abstracts" Indico module filter the abstracts list to display only abstracts that are in the "**Submitted**" status (use the blue "Customise list" button to open the filters window):

Select all the abstracts to be accepted, then choose "**Accept**" from the "**Judge**" pop-up button:

A new window will appear. Please select "Use review track" to keep the track that was chosen before during the review phase.

Also select "Override contribution type" and then "Poster Presentation" from the following popup menu..

We also recommend to directly assign posters to sessions: a finer filtering on tracks may be needed before performing this step.

You surely don't want to notify the submitter at this stage, so leave this option unchecked.

By pressing "Judge" contributions will be created from the previously selected abstracts.
