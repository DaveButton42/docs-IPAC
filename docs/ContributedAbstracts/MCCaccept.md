# Accepting contributed oral presentations by MC Coordinators during SPC/3

---

*This is an explanation for the Scientific Programme Committee MC Coordinators (SPC-MCC) on how to perform the **last steps of the [Workflow for selection of Contributed Abstracts](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

---

Before the SPC/3 meeting the MC Coordinators will work on the abstracts reviewed by the SPC, usually starting from an [export prepared by the Scientific Secretariat](../InvitedOrals/SStipsandtricks.md#1-get-a-spreadsheet-summary-of-reviews). Every coordinator will propose a set of abstracts, together with a number of backups, to the SPC/3 for final discussion and approval. 

Whenever the final list of oral presentations has been approved, every MC Coordinator will act in their assigned Main Classification (Track Group) and work through all of the proposals to be accepted, then "judging" them, i.e. accepting them as invited orals, in the correct track. 

Please refer to the [instructions available for invited oral presentations](../InvitedOrals/MCCaccept.md) for the details.

Alternatively, this job can be left to the Scientific Secretariat who can work through the accepted abstracts via the Management Area and "judge" on behalf of the MC Coordinators.
