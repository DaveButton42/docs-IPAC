# Accept/Reject Proposals for Track Changes by MC Coordinators

---

*This is an explanation for the Main Classification Coordinators (MCC) on how to perform the **third step of the [Simplified workflow for selection of Contributed Abstracts](intro.md#simplified-workflow)**..*

---

The Coordinator/Convener clicks on the Track for which they are responsible and sees the following (*example for MC1*):

![](../InvitedOrals/img/abstracts_to_retrack.png)

The Coordinators/Conveners are asked to work through the abstracts in their Tracks and  concentrate on the abstracts where there is a proposal for a change of track. 

We will show this with an example.

**Taking ID 39 above**, clicking on the title of the submission the Coordinator/Convener will see the following:

![](../InvitedOrals/img/reviews.png)

The Coordinator can see that the abstract was *submitted in MC1* and that there is a *proposal to move it to MC2*.

## When no track change is needed

**If the Coordinator/Convener disagrees with the track change proposal, they should do nothing**. They should simply disregard the proposal. The original abstract will remain in the originally proposed Track. The Coordinator simply returns to the list of abstracts to be reviewed.

## When there is need to change the initially proposed track

**If the Coordinator/Convener agrees with the track change proposal, they should click on *Edit Track List* link shown here above, select the proposed new Track, and Save**:

---

**Note**: be sure to **select one track only**. You should uncheck all other tracks selected like, in the example above, MC1.

---

Abstract ID#39 then disappears from the MC1 list:

![](../InvitedOrals/img/abstracts_list_wo_39.png)

and appears under MC2. 
Now, if the MC2 Coordinator/Convener agrees, they will leave the abstract as it is. If they disagree they will edit the Track List again. Good communication among MC coordinators will ease this task for sure.

**Note**: *Coordinators/Conveners should at this stage refrain from using any other functionality.*
