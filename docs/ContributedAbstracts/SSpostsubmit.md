# Post submission duties for Admin

When the deadline for submission of contributed abstracts is over, the Scientific Secretariat/Admin should check that no abstracts can be submitted by manually closing the submission possibility in `Workflow > Call for Abstracts`.
The `Authorised submitters` list in the Call for Abstracts *Settings* should also be empty and populated only for very exceptional cases.
