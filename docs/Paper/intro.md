# Paper editing workflow

Paper editing in JACoW conferences refers to reviewing the layout and readability of a [paper submitted for the proceedings](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/HomePage) in relation to the [JACoW template](https://github.com/JACoW-org/JACoW_Templates/raw/master/LaTeX/A4/JACoW_LaTeX_A4.pdf).

In the rest of this documentation weâ€™ll refer to the document being assessed as an `editable` for the sake of simplification. Still in the case of the editing module, this document could be a paper, a slides deck or a poster. The editing process is exactly the same for all three types of documents.

## Editing States

The editable can be in one of the following states:

- **Ready to Review** - the editable is ready to be assigned and reviewed by an editor right after its submission.
- **Assigned** - the editable has been assigned to an editor ("<code style="color: purple">purple dot</code>").
- **Accepted** - final state - the editable has been accepted ("<code style="color: green">green dot</code>").
- **Rejected** - final state - the editable has been rejected; This status is usually not used in JACoW conferences.
- **Needs changes** - the editable needs corrections to be performed **by the author(s)** ("<code style="color: red">red dot</code>");
- **Needs confirmation** - the editor has made modifications to the editable, which **need to be approved** by the author(s) ("<code style="color: gold">yellow dot</code>").
- **In QA** - After the editor accepts the paper, the QA editors do a last quality check before the paper is published. This is characterised by an "Accepted" status and a "QA02: QA Pending" tag.
- **Final** (**QA'd**)- the editable is ready for publishing. This is characterised by an "Accepted" status and a "QA01: QA Approved" tag.

Here is a diagram of the editing states process:
