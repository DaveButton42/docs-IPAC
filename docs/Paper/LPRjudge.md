# Light Peer Review: tasks for the judge (or LPR manager)

The workflow of a paper judge is largely similar to that of a reviewer. Judges can only judge papers assigned to them by paper managers.


The list of papers that you can judge is available in the _Judging area_.

**Note**: the LPR manager can at any time judge any submitted paper even if not explicitly assigned to them from the *management area*.

Paper judges have the final say when it comes to accepting a paper. They can either accept or reject a paper or request corrections. If corrections are requested,
the author of the paper will be able to submit a new version which needs to be reviewed and judged again.

*Note that a paper can only be judged by one judge.*

Before adding a judgement, make sure that reviewers have had the chance to review the paper. You can see the assigned reviewers in the _Judging area_.
Judgements can be reset by clicking on the _Reset judgement_ icon in the judgement box:

As a judge, you can also leave comments on a paper before adding a judgement.

**Note**: Both reviewing and judging might have a set deadline, after which it is not possible to review or judge papers. If a deadline is set, you will see it in the Reviewing and Judging areas.
