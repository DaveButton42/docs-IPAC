# Organising Committees

The organizing committees of IPAC, similar to other major events, are the (international) Organizing Committee (**OC**), the Scientific Programme Committee (**SPC**), the Local Organizing Committee (**LOC**), the Scientific Advisory Board (**SAB**), and the Editorial Board (**EB**).

With the introduction of a 3-year cycle and the merging of the former APAC, EPAC and
PAC into IPAC, first Asia and then North
America, decided to adopt a similar approach to
the conference organization, described in the
EPS-AG Revised Statutes and Rules, attached in
Annex 2. The main concept is that the SPC is a
sub-committee of the OC. For both the OC and
the SPC, half of the members come from the
region organizing the conference, and half from
the rest of the world.


The coordination of IPAC is described in a
Memorandum of Understanding, signed by
representatives of the three regions during
IPAC’15 in Richmond, VA, USA. The MoU is
published at the Website of the (restricted
access) International Particle Accelerator
Conferences
Coordination
Committee
(IPACCC).



## Organizing Committee (OC)


An IPAC OC is composed of 32 members,
including the Chair. In Europe the Chair of the
OC is also the Chair of the EPS-AG Elected
Board. In Europe the OC is composed of the
16 members of the Elected Board, plus
8 members from each of the other two regions.
Further members, for instance the Scientific
Secretariat, may be co-opted as necessary.


The OC decides policy, considers and
approves, or rejects, proposals submitted by the
SPC and the LOC. The OC normally meets
twice, once at the outset of the organization, and
once more during the conference.



## Scientific Programme Committee (SPC)


The SPC is a sub-committee of the OC. It is
composed of a Chair, who in Europe is the
Chair-elect of the EPS-AG Elected Board, and
16 members: eight from the region, and four
from each of the other two regions. Further
members may be co-opted as necessary,
normally the OC/LOC Chairs, the person(s)
responsible for the Scientific Secretariat, a
further LOC member to ensure good
coordination with the LOC, etc.


The job of the SPC is to develop the scientific
programme, including the Session on
Engagement with Industry, manage the student
poster session judging, participate in the light
reviewing, decisions concerning potential PR-
AB papers, etc.


The eight SPC members from the region, with
the role of Session Coordinator, are each
responsible for one of the 8 Main Classifications
adopted for the scientific programme. Eight
further members, 4 from each of the other two
regions, act as Shadow, or Deputy Coordinators.


The SPC proposes candidates for membership
of a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), it defines
the Main and Sub-classifications used to group
contributions by topic. With input from the OC
and SAB, it proposes the programme of invited
oral presentations. It proposes contributed oral
presentations for the approval of the OC
following the call for papers.



## Local Organizing Committee (LOC)


The LOC is normally composed of staff from
hosting institutes – but this is not hard and fast.
If the LOC needs outside expertise, a PCO for
example, it should get it on board early on. The
person responsible for the Scientific Secretariat
is also a member of the LOC. In Europe, the
LOC Chair, and a further LOC member,
participate in meetings of the OC/SPC to ensure
excellent
coordination
between
these
committees and the organization at the local
level. The LOC meets as many times as
necessary, the meetings becoming more
frequent and targeting more specific issues as
the conference approaches.


The LOC takes the responsibility for
organizing the event at the local level, based on
the decisions of the OC/SPC.


More and more frequently Professional
Conference Organizers (PCOs) are being hired
to take responsibility for registration,
accommodation, the organization of the
industrial exhibition, together with the Industrial
Exhibition Manager who is a LOC member,
space management, the organization of social
events, etc. They are members of the LOC. Note
that contracting a PCO to organize various
portions of the conference does not mean
complete outsourcing. The control over PCO
activities should always remain with the LOC.



## Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)


The SAB is normally composed of
40 members from the region hosting the
conference, and 25 each from the other two
regions. The SPC Chair invites suggestions for
SAB members from SPC members, who
generally consult with their colleagues on the
OC.


The SAB does not meet. It is traditionally
invited to submit proposals for invited oral
presentations via the SPMS, and also to make
suggestions on the organization of the event.
Members are kept informed of developments,
and those attending the conference are invited to
the Chairmen’s cocktail. Following the
conference the SAB is asked for feedback,
which is passed on to the next conference
organizers.



## Scientific Secretariat (SS)


The title Scientific Secretariat was coined to
fit the job description of the author many years
ago. The job description can vary nowadays
depending on the conference, the region, the
staffing possibilities. The SS is composed of at
least one person who is responsible for the tasks
listed below, and who often joins forces with at
least one person with the responsibility for the
IT side of the production of the proceedings
(organizing the IT, the computers and printers
set up and installed with appropriate software),
and often a further person running various
scripts during the conference, as well as the
final JACoW publication scripts package
(JPSP).


It is efficient if the SS sets up a password
protected website for the Organizers (OC/SPC
members). The SS organizes and prepares
Agendas and Notes of all OC/SPC meetings, to
be published there together with all background
or useful documentation. The SS follows up on
all actions, working closely with the
OC/SPC/LOC Chairs and Committees to ensure
excellent coordination across all committees.
This provides the conference archive.


The SS is responsible for all of the texts
published at the conference website relating to author information and the scientific
programme.


The SS is normally the SPMS Database
Administrator (DBA), ensuring that the system
parameters reflect the different activities in the
life of the organization of the conference,
assigning the different privileges to the people
responsible for the various activities.


The SS is the interface between the
conference,
the
scientific
programme
organization and the contributors/delegates,
managing all communications via SPMS.


The SS is responsible for setting up and
organizing the JACoW team ready for on-line
processing of contributions to the proceedings
during the conference, generally with an IT
Manager, and for the publication of the
proceedings at the JACoW site as soon after the
conference as possible.


In the Americas, and in PAC jargon, the
“Editor” had the responsibility to produce the
proceedings, which until 1996 involved
collecting outsize sheets of camera-ready copy,
producing a table of contents, adding page
numbers, and shipping everything to a printer.
The Editor had very little involvement in the
organization of the scientific programme.


When the author of this document joined the
organization of PAC ’07, NA-PACs ’11 and ’13
and IPAC’12, she assumed the role and
responsibilities of the SS, as in Europe and
Asia. IPACs '15 and '18 in the US have both
adopted the concept of a SS, assisted by other
persons as necessary.


The personal opinion of the author is that
successful prompt publication is more
efficiently achieved if the SS is involved in all
of the activities relating to the scientific
programme or involving the use of the SPMS
providing for a seamless effort from start to
finish of the conference.


“Scientific Secretariat” may not be the best
term, but the jobs described in these paragraphs
do result in a more than full time activity at least
during the year leading up to the conference.
Scientific Programme Coordinator, could be a
possible title for the person carrying out all of
the above. The title "Editor" should be reserved for the person with responsibility for the
**publication** of the proceedings, if that person is
different from the SS.



## Editorial Board (EB)


Since the outset of electronic publication at
EPAC, the SS worked together with some more
technical people (IT, scripting, etc.) to produce
the proceedings.


This small group collaborated early on at the
planning stage to ensure that the relatively
complex hard- and software, server and
networking requirements were met for pre-
conference, conference and post-conference
activities. The group came to be called an
Editorial Board (EB) and today it is usually
composed of:

- the SS responsible for the interface with
  contributors through the SPMS and veracity
  of the metadata in the SPMS (table of
  contents, author index, wrappers)
- IT Manager (soft- and hardware, webserver,
  file server, networking, setting up of all
  computers, printers, etc.)
- the SPC and LOC Chairs (respectively for
  scientific content and for budget)
- the person who runs the scripts to pull the
  final proceedings together, if different from
  the SS/IT Manager.
  The EB does not meet. The SS is the Chair of
  the EB.

## JACoW


IPAC is a member of the Joint Accelerator
Conferences Website (JACoW) Collaboration.
JACoW is an international collaboration in
electronic publication of accelerator conference
proceedings.
Organization,
membership
conditions and requirements are set out in detail
in a Charter published at the JACoW.org
website.


Requests to join the Collaboration are
approved by the Board of Directors.
Membership is conditional on a commitment
from each series to publish at least three sets of
proceedings at the site and send their Editors
(past, current and future) to the annual JACoW
Team Meetings.



The persons or EBs with the responsibility for
the publication of proceedings, sometimes
known as "editors", of the past, current and
future conferences in each series, members of
the JACoW Collaboration, form the JACoW
Team.


Team members new to electronic publication
can take advantage of introductory "hands on"
training in basic processing techniques during
major JACoW events (IPAC, NA-PAC,
LINAC, FEL, ICALEPCS, etc.). Conference
editors with little experience can also call on
help from JACoW’s experts, normally by
inviting them on to a guest editorial team during
the conferences, on the condition that their local
expenses are covered.


Each conference series is encouraged to build
in a certain amount of continuity via the editors,
inviting past and future editors as “guest
editors” at each event.


More importantly, collaborating conference
series undertake to send their Team members
(Editors of the past, current and future event in
each series), to the Team Meetings organized
around the end of each year, rotating around
Asia, Europe and the US. Conferences should
include an item in the conference budget to
cover this.


Team Meetings provide the opportunity for
members of the Collaboration to pursue in
greater depth all issues related to electronic
publication, as well as the development of tools
such as the Scientific Programme Management
System (SPMS), Indico and the scripts which pull all
of the individual files of contributions together
into the final publication package known as the
JACoW Proceedings Scripts Package (JPSP)
developed by Volker Schaa (GSI).
Professional electronic publication is not
trivial, it cannot be improvised, and to publish
according to JACoW's high standards implies
that Team members receive adequate training,
but also once their expertise is acquired, that
they remain members of the Team for a certain
period in order to take part in the training of
novice editors.


Since JACoW is based on good will,
attendance at Team Meetings and participation in JACoW activities is essential to maintain
high standards and continuity and to the success
of the entire venture. *JACoW therefore reserves
the right to exclude from publication any
conferences not respecting this condition*.
