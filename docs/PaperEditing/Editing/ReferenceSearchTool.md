# Reference Search Tool

The [JACoW Reference Search Tool](https://refs.jacow.org) can search all papers from published proceedings on JACoW.org and papers from currently unpublished proceedings and conferences.

Now it also works with references of non-JACoW papers! 

**Note**: in these tutorials the chosen format is BibLaTeX. Please note that you can also use other formats as needed!
