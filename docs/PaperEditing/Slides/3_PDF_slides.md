# Processing PDF slides

There are different processing procedures for PDF slides and PowerPoint presentations. For PDF slides the following steps should be done:

- **check for missing fonts** in Acrobat with shortcut-key CTRL-D

- **do a visual inspection** of the presentation and look for overlapping content or missing characters. Missing characters are displayed as blank boxes. Macintosh talks processed on a Windows computer can be an issue.
  
  Overlapping content can be fixed in the corresponding PowerPoint slides file which has been uploaded by the speaker as a "Source file".

- **remove backup slides** in Acrobat. Some speakers prepare extra or spare slides for their presentation - these so called backup slides should be removed before publication.
