# How to login to the IPAC Indico event

## Getting to the Indico event

The address of the IPAC event you want to access is surely published on the website of the conference (usually, <https://ipacXX.org> - e.g., <https://ipac23.org>, <https://ipac24.org> etc.)

The usual URL for IPAC Indico events is <https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPACXX> (e.g., [IPAC'23](https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPAC23), [IPAC'24](https://indico.jacow.org/e/IPAC24) etc.)

## Your JACoW account

All JACoW conference are organised around the **JACoW Central Repository** which is an enormous database of **_profiles_** (personal data including name, email and affiliation) and **_accounts_** (profiles with a username and password which allow login). Profiles are usually created by authors while submitting an abstract and adding co-authors not yet present in the Central Repository. Accounts can be created by any individual.

!!! warning "Decommissioning of the SPMS"
    As of the 17th of March 2025, the JACoW Central Repository in the SPMS has been retired. 

    The current JACoW Central Repository is hence managed directly by and in the JACoW Indico system at [https://indico.jacow.org](https://indico.jacow.org).
