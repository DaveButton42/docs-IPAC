# How the JACoW proceedings creation works

When all the papers have been edited and accepted for publication it is possible to create the conference proceedings that will eventually be published on the [JACoW proceedings website](https://www.jacow.org/Main/Proceedings).

The tool that actually creates the proceedings is called [CAT - Conference Assembly Tool](https://cat-docs.jacow.org/). This section will go through the instructions on how to use it.

CAT is not part of Indico. In fact, it is an external web application ([MEOW](https://meow-docs.jacow.org/)) driven by a JACoW Indico plugin ([PURR](https://purr-docs.jacow.org/)). PURR needs to be configured first. [Please refer to its documentation](https://purr-docs.jacow.org/Functionalities/statusAndSettings/) for the details of all its settings.

Before creating the proceedings, it is necessary to perform a number of checks on the paper PDFs, on Poster presentations, on the slides of the oral presentations and on the contribution's metadata. These steps are described here as well.
