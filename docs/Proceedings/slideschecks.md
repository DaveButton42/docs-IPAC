# Slides check

CAT can publish slides presented at the conference together with their related paper, independently.

[A process similar to that related to paper editing](/Paper/intro) is to be followed. Only slide files in the   status of QA OK will be present in the proceedings. If, for any reason, a presentation is not to be published (e.g., the author can have denied the permission to publish), we recommend to not set its status to QA OK or, to be more explicit, set its status to "Rejected" (please be sure to provide good comments for the author and for any other editor).
