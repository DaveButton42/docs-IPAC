Papers in the IPAC proceedings are given a unique [DOI](https://doi.org) built from the PURR settings and the paper's programme code:

DOIs are registered by CAT via [Datacite](https://datacite.org/) by way of the DOI button in PURR's interface:

Datacite credentials are needed to actually register the DOIs. Contact the [JACoW Board of Directors](https://www.jacow.org/Main/Contacts) to get directions about these settings.
