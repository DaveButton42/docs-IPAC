# Delivery of a JACoW-Indico Event

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of a JACoW-Indico Event upon delivery to the Event Manager. It describes the entry of general information and
preparations for developing the scientific programme. A
further document describes how to run the activities
relating to scientific programme management through the
event, progressing chronologically up to the conference.
Official Indico documentation is available at:
[Defining the Programme - Learning Indico](https://learn.getindico.io/conferences/programme/)

Note: This Indico documentation corresponds to
"normal" Indico and it does not always include the more
JACoW-specific functionality described in JACoW-Indico documentation.

The JACoW Events Manager, or a JACoW Officer
with Admin privileges on the JACoW-Indico site creates
JACoW-Indico instances (events) upon receipt of a
formal request to the JACoW Chair or Coordinator. The
JACoW-Indico event is delivered with the **Admin**
permissions assigned to the **Event Administrator**, who is
the person designated to run the JACoW-Indico event
within the conference organization.

The Event Administrator is normally either the
**Scientific Secretary** or the **Editor-in-Chief**. This person is
also normally the JACoW Team Member, or an Associate
Team Member and contact person for JACoW
Management, with the responsibility to check
documentation relating to the event published on
jacow.org, for example concerning the conference, its
venue and dates, the names of OC/SPC/LOC Chairs,
Stakeholders, etc.


The **Admin** privileges upon delivery of the JACoW-
Indico event will also be assigned to several JACoW
Experts, usually the JACoW Events Manager, the JACoW
Chair and the Coordinator. Depending on the event, some
other persons may also be assigned Admin privileges.
Note that a major difference working with Indico is that
contributions to the proceedings will be uploaded to
Indico, and no longer to the JACoW paper servers at PSI
and JLab.


JACoW-Indico events are linked to the JACoW SPMS
Central Repository of Profiles and Affiliations.



## Delivery of a JACoW-Indico Event

The Event Administrator receives a link to their
event:

**https://indico.jacow.org/e/<ConfName\>**

This is the "display view". The main pane contains the
basic information provided to the JACoW Events
Manager, for example, the name of the event and the start
and end dates. The Overview pane on the left hand side 
shows the areas of the event open to the person logging
in. This area will change as new permissions are added or
removed.

The pen icon in the top grey bar leads to the
Management Area for the event:

![](img/enter_management.png)

The pane on the left has a number of different links:
Settings, Timetable, Protection, Organization, Workflows,
Reports, Customization and Advanced Options. The
Event Administrator will organize the event via these
links.

This document explains the activities behind the links
in the Management Area. It is divided into Sections as
listed in the left pane of Indico.
