# Management Area

## Customization

The site Customization screen is divided into four areas:
Images, Layout, Menu and Posters/Badges.

A general tutorial is availabe at [Customizing the Conference Page Layout - Learning Indico](https://learn.getindico.io/conferences/custom_layout/).

### Images

This screen is used to enter images to appear at the site.

Usually we don't need any image to be uploaded here.

### Layout

This screen customizes the layout of the site under
General, Header Style, Announcement, Timetable, and
Theme. At the bottom of the page is a link enabling entry
of a fully customized stylesheet and another area to enter
an Event Logo. An example of a stylesheet can be
uploaded.

  Selecting orange or brown defines the background colour
  of the header on the conference page. The Event logo, if

  If under Header Style above a text and background colour
  has been selected, the above colour theme is disabled.
